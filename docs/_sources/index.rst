Mapof-Elections
===============

Mapof-elections is a Python package that serves for simplifying simulations and experiments related to elections. The most fundamental functions that mapel offers are:

    * Generating elections from numerous election models;
    * Computing distances between elections;
    * Printing a map of elections--that is, a graphical representation of elections in a 2d space, where each point is associated to a certain election.
